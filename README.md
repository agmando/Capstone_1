# Capstone_1

For my capstone project, I’m using data to help a pizza restaurant plan for a pizza resturant I’m analyzing sales and menu data to identify popular items and seasonal trends, focusing on how to boost sales during slower months. The goal is to optimize the menu and provide insights that will attract potential investors. I’ll present key findings and data visualizations to support the restaurant's growth and menu strategy.
